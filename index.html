      <h3 style="text-align: center;">About the Founder</h3>
      <p style="font-size:18px; text-align: justify;">Mr. Mercadejas is the one behind the early success of the company despite being new in the industry.  
        He continuously brings accomplishment to the company by building branches along the cities and malls that gives 
        opportunities to people who need a job.  The idea of making his own publishing company started when he was 16 years 
        old where he began to love reading and collecting books.  He was amazed at how the smell of the pages of a new book 
        and the sight of shelves filled with books gives relaxation and sanity to him. 
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:18px; text-align: justify;">From that day, he wanted to share and spread the admiration he has for books so he started to build a publishing company 
        that will print pages from the author and genre.  He is overwhelmed on how the people loved and appreciated the quality 
        they gave to the books people loved and waited to be published.  He had a vision and a goal of bringing the best quality 
        books every author and book lover deserved.</p>

          <h4>THE FAULT IN OUR STARS</h4>
          <p style="font-size:15px ;text-align: justify;">Despite the tumor-shrinking medical miracle that has bought her a few years, Hazel has never 
            been anything but terminal, her final chapter inscribed upon diagnosis. But when a gorgeous 
            plot twist named Augustus Waters suddenly appears at Cancer Kid Support Group, Hazel’s story

          <h4>THE DA VINCI CODE</h4>
          <p style="font-size:15px ;text-align: justify;">While in Paris, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is awakened by a phone call in the dead of the night. 
            The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum; his body covered in baffling symbols. 
            As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned 
            to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci—clues visible for all to see and yet 
            ingeniously disguised by the painter.<span id="dots">..</span><span id="more">
          </br></br>
            Even more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion—a secret society whose members 
            included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci—and he guarded a breathtaking historical secret. 
            Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle—while avoiding the faceless adversary 
            who shadows their every move—the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.</span>
